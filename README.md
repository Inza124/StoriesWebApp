One of the first applications written by me while learning to create web applications in ruby on rails. This is an application heavily inspired by "Anonimowi" or "Wyznajemy" type portals. The Devise gem has been used to create user roles. I used the PostgreSQL database.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by one of the teachers at the university to learn ruby on rails. I wanted to create a web application at the same time, which will not be very complicated and at the same time let me learn a lot. I did not want it to be some simple blog, so I decided to create its more advanced version
